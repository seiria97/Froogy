# Froogy
Froogy  is a simple, browser-based study timer designed to help students stay focused and manage their study sessions effectively. Inspired by popular timer apps and YouTube study videos, this project allows you to set custom timers, short breaks, and long breaks while keeping track of your progress in a fun, visual way.
